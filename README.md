# Trophy Tracker 2

[**Trophy Tracker 2**](https://github.com/andyeder/trophy-tracker-2) (from here on referred to as **TT2**) is a _"from the ground up"_ redesign and rewrite of Trophy Tracker. The primary aim is for TT2 to become a useful resource for those people who are interested in the RenaultSport (RS) Clio 182 Trophy car.

### More about the RS Clio 182 Trophy

The **RS Clio 182 Trophy** is a special edition variant of the RS Clio Mk2, limited to a production run of only 550 vehicles. 500 vehicles were made for the UK market, and an additional 50 vehicles were built for the Swiss market. Apart from the location of the steering wheel (right-hand drive for the UK and left-hand drive for Switzerland), the cars were virtually identical and boasted a few high-end parts to set the Trophy apart from the _regular_ RS Clio model. Following its release in 2005, the RS Clio 182 Trophy received many awards and plaudits for its fantastic driving dynamics and quickly gained a significant following within the automotive and performance car world. As a result, the Trophy (due to its success and limited availability) became quite a sought after vehicle and is still held in high regard to this day. However, Trophy enthusiasts (especially discerning potential owners!) are generally quite careful when it comes to buying these vehicles as they do generally command a significant premium over the non-Trophy variants in the RS Clio Mk2 range. Said potential owners tend to be genuine enthusiasts when it comes to limited edition cars like this, hence they will often do their homework and thoroughly research a target vehicle before parting with their hard-earned cash. This is where TT2 can really help.

### Why Trophy Tracker 2?

TT2 (and, indeed, the original Trophy Tracker) was borne of the idea that it would be incredibly useful to have some kind of register or resource that could provide the Trophy enthusiast with all the information they need about a specific vehicle. After all, each Trophy that rolled off of the production line was assigned a unique ID number, #001 to #500 inclusive for the UK production cars and #01 to #50 for the Swiss cars. However, it didn't quite work out that way...

For whatever reason, Renault decided _not_ to maintain any form of register that would uniquely identify a specific car (such as keeping a record of the unique ID number against the Vehicle Identification Number/VIN)! The only way that any given Trophy could be identified (in terms of its unique number) was by a small sticker that was placed on the side of the Recaro seats! Of course, some of these stickers could fade, become damaged/lost, or even end up sold if the owenr decided to swap out the seats for something else. If this happened, it provided difficult to identify the unique number of that specific Trophy and, consequently, more difficult to find out more about the history of the car.

Trophy Tracker, and now TT2, has been designed to provide the user with useful information that will help identify a given RS Clio 182 Trophy. In addition, the user will also be presented with further information providing a useful history of that specific car. The user will also be able to call up that car's MOT data (at least for UK cars, thanks to a partnership with the DVSA that allows TT2 to use their MOT API).

### Development

TT2 is wholly designed, developed and maintained by Andy Eder ([github](https://github.com/andyeder)) and Tracy-Gregory Gilmore ([github](https://github.com/TracyGJG)).
